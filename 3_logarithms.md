log is used for more complex algorithms.

log is a inverse of pow.
log2(value) = exponent ---> 2exponent = value

log2(8) = 3

Most common is log2 but there can be log10 or logE
We do not care rly if the log is 2 so we ommit it and write just log.

If we have not even numbers we just check roughtly how many times we have to divide until first number hits 1 or it is first number that hit below 1

Log complexity is really good
Complexity from best to worst are:

n2 > n log n > n > log n > 1

Certian searching algorithms have logarithmic time complexity

Efficient sorting algorithms involve logarithms

recursion sometimes involves logarithmic space complexity
